Code for the **Safari Live Training** - Introduction to Python Programming

## Set up instructions
### 1. Install Python 3.6 or higher
Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/

Click the yellow button at the top to download the latest version of Python.

#### On Mac or Linux
Follow the prompts and install using the default settings.

#### On Windows
The default settings don't add Python to your PATH 
so your computer doesn't know where to look for it when Python runs 
(for some inexplicable reason).

##### If you're just installing Python now
Follow the instructions here: [Windows Python installer instructions](docs/WININSTALL.md)

##### If you've already installed Python with the default settings
Follow the instructions here: [Add Python to PATH variable in Windows](docs/WINSETPATH.md)

### 2. Download PyCharm (Community Edition)
Download here: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/

Install, open, and use the default settings.

### 3. Download the course files
Go here: https://github.com/ariannedee/intro-to-python

#### If you know git:
Clone the repository.

#### If you don't know git:
1. Click the "Clone or download" (green) button
2. Click "Download ZIP"
3. Unzip it and move the **intro-to-python-master** folder to a convenient location

### 4. Make sure that Python is properly installed
1. Open the *Command Prompt* application in Windows
or *Terminal* on Mac or Linux

1. Type `python --version` and press enter

1. Type `python3 --version` and press enter

1. One or both of those commands should print 
a Python version of 3.7.1 or higher 
(whichever version you just downloaded)

**Note:** 
You can now type just the `python` or `python3` command
in *Command Prompt* or *Terminal* 
to run the Python interpreter.
You can also run a *.py* file by running 
`python filename.py`
